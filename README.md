# FitPro

## An interactive fitness app.

FitPro is a fitness app that caters to the workout experience level of the user. The initial setup allows the user to create an account and select one aspect of fitness for each day of the week. For example, user Bob could select Monday as his leg workout day, Tuesday as his chest workout day, Wednesday as his core strength training and cardio day, and so on. Each of these categories will also have workout regimes of varying intensity, designed to cater to each user’s comfort level. For example, Bob could select a novice’s workout regime for yoga, and pick an intermediate level for leg day depending on his comfort level and experience.<br />
<br />
Once everything is set, the next time Bob goes to the gym, all he has to do is login to the app and tap the day to begin his timed workouts. An alarm will sound at the completion of each exercise, which will allow Bob to keep track of his sets and prevent him from unnecessary dawdling at the gym.
